## How to Play

1. **Start:** Click on any image to begin the game.
2. **Earn Points:** Every time you click on an image that you haven't clicked on before in that round, your score will increase.
3. **Avoid Repetition:** Remember which images you have already clicked on. Clicking on the same image more than once will reset your score to zero.
4. **Challenge Yourself:** Try to beat your high score in subsequent rounds by clicking on more unique images each time.
